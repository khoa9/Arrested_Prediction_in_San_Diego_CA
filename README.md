# Traffic Stop Arrest Prediction - San Diego, California

## Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person being arrested during a traffic stop in San Diego, California. The prediction is based on historical data collected from traffic stops in San Diego up to the year 2020. By developing a machine learning model, we aim to provide valuable insights into the factors that influence the outcome of a traffic stop and help law enforcement agencies in making informed decisions.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about traffic stops in San Diego, including various attributes such as demographic information of the driver, reason for the stop, location, date and time, and the outcome of the stop (arrest, citation, warning, etc.).

### Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

**1. Data Collection**: The dataset was collected from the San Diego Police Department's records up to the end of March 2020. It includes thousands of traffic stops with associated attributes.

**2. Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing involves cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering. This step ensures that the data is ready for model training.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA involves data visualization and statistical analysis to gain insights into the dataset. We explore relationships between different features and the target variable (arrest outcome).

**4. Feature Selection**: We select relevant features that are likely to influence the arrest outcome, based on the results of EDA.
 
**5. Model Selection**: We experiment with different machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests to build predictive models.

**6. Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

**7. Results**: We present the results of the trained model, including insights into the most influential factors in predicting arrests during traffic stops.

**8. Conclusion**: We summarize the findings of the project, discuss potential use cases, and suggest areas for further research.


### Results
The project aims to provide insights into the factors that contribute to arrests during traffic stops in California (sample: San Diego). The trained machine learning model can be used to predict the likelihood of an arrest based on specific circumstances during a traffic stop.

Key results and findings will be presented within the Jupyter Notebook files and can be visualized through data visualizations and performance metrics.

### Future Work
The model's predictions can be used by law enforcement agencies to enhance their decision-making processes during traffic stops.
Ongoing data collection can help improve model accuracy and relevance as new information becomes available.
The project can be extended to explore additional factors and data sources that may influence traffic stop outcomes.
